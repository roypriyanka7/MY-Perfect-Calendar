# A Multi-purpose Schedule Management Application (My Perfect Calendar)

## Inspiration

Our main goal was to create something which could help a student in their studies. A student needs to study. He has a lot of tasks to complete apart from studies. In both cases, time need to be managed well. As time management is the key to a students’ success, we’ve made an android application which can help them to maintain their schedule and tasks smoothly.

## Objectives

- Aiding students with their scheduling and maintaining timetable for study, classes and daily activities
- Setting up monthly goals through ‘Save to my diary’ or ‘My To-Do List’ and staying on track
- To-do list and event reminder to get reminded about important tasks and deadlines
- Helping with an alarm system
- Stopwatch feature to help one with timeliness
- A digital clock included
- Many in One facility meaning many features in a single app
- Student-friendly app.
